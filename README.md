# Numpy Array Analysis Tool

This tool provides a comprehensive analysis of a 3x3 matrix, delivering key statistical insights including mean, variance, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and sum across the matrix's rows, columns, and its entirety. Built using Python and leveraging the power of NumPy, this utility is designed to assist data scientists, engineers, and mathematicians in their exploratory data analysis tasks.

## Features

- **Mean Calculation:** Computes the mean across rows, columns, and the entire matrix.
- **Variance Calculation:** Determines the variance across rows, columns, and the entire matrix, offering insights into data spread.
- **Standard Deviation:** Calculates the standard deviation, providing a measure of data dispersion.
- **Maximum Value:** Identifies the maximum value within the rows, columns, and the entire matrix.
- **Minimum Value:** Identifies the minimum value within the rows, columns, and the entire matrix.
- **Summation:** Calculates the sum of elements across rows, columns, and the entire matrix.
